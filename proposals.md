# Proposals

* Use our Github organization account ([rcc-uchicago](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago)) 
  for [lightweight project management](https://github.com/Lullabot/github-pm) and 
  packaging project deliverables:

  * code
  * data
  * docs
  * doc site (with [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/))

  See [example project](https://github.com/dssg/bikeshare).

* Use the [data package](http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/) spec as a
  baseline convention for data package metadata.

* Use the [tabular data package](http://dataprotocols.org/tabular-data-package/) spec as 
  a convention for describing the schemas of tabular datasets.

* Test out [dat](https://github.com/maxogden/dat) as a basis for real-time
  replication and versioning for large tabular data sets.
