# Mission

RCC Services Group statement of purpose.

Our role is to aid research teams at the University of Chicago that would like to repurpose (preserve, extend, and amplify) their high-value data collections into vehicles for data-discovery for targeted research needs.  

While the RCC and Computation Institute have long provided data management and
high-performance computing services (i.e., general data/computational infrastructure services independent of any particular research domain), our focus will be on developing custom data-discovery capabilities for specific research communities. 

---

We help University research teams transform the data they've collected in the course of some project (with a particular analytical objective) into an explorable research dataset that's tailored to the specific needs of a research community (with perhaps quite different analytical objectives) extending beyond the team that initially collected the data.  The targeted community may be future members of an internal team, an interdisciplinary team within the University, or a larger and more distributed community of researchers.

In short, we aim to repurpose high-value data collections for new forms of data-discovery.
