# Tools

Core tools used by the RCC Services Group.


## Node 

RCC Web Services leverages [Node](http://nodejs.org/) as a platform for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications.  It enables rapid development of both HTTP+JSON APIs as well as native web apps.
