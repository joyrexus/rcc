# XROMM

X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology ([XROMM](http://www.xromm.org/)) is a 3D imaging technology, developed at Brown University, for visualizing rapid skeletal movement in vivo.

[Callum Ross](http://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/ross_c.html) is the PI on the project.

See Robin's [project notes](https://w3.rcc.uchicago.edu/redmine/projects/rcc/wiki/Callum_Ross_Assessment_of_Needs) for details.
