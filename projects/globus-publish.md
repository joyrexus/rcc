# Globus Publishing

Overview and docs can be found [here](https://www.globus.org/data-publication).

Note that the Library's Digital Services division would like to evaluate the
new globus features as a potential piece of their effort to offer an
institutional repository here at the U of C with curated special collections
(e.g., interdisciplinary data collections generated by Neubauer Collegium
funded projects, etc.).


## Questions

#### Can non-Globus users search for available datasets?

Yes, that's a planned feature.


#### Where is publishing currently being beta-tested?

There are no current beta-tested.  They're looking for an early-adopter rollout
and testing phase in Q3 of 2014.


#### Is there going to be an API?

Highly likely.


#### Will it be an [OAI-compliant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archives_Initiative_Protocol_for_Metadata_Harvesting) repository?

Yes, that's a planned feature.
